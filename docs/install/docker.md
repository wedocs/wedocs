for all project components. An overview of available images can be found

Please refer to [Quickstart Docker-Compose]({{<ref "/guides/docker-compose.md">}})
for a guide on getting started with Docker Compose.

## Versioning

* `latest` refers to the latest version from the `master` branch. It is not
  recommeded to use this for production!
* All other tags refer to tagged versions. Note that there are tags that point
  to a specific MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version, but also tags to the latest
  MAJOR.MINOR and MAJOR.
