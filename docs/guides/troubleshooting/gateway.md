# Troubleshooting gateway connectivity

This guide helps you to troubleshoot gateway connectivity issues and to find the
underlying cause. This guide assumes you already have the
[LoRa Gateway Bridge](/lora-gateway-bridge/) component installed and running.

We will validate in this guide:

* If the [packet-forwarder](https://github.com/lora-net/packet_forwarder) is receiving device data
* If the [LoRa Gateway Bridge](/lora-gateway-bridge/) is receiving data from the packet-forwarder
* If LoRa Gateway Bridge is publishing the data to the MQTT broker

## Semtech packet-forwarder sends data?

The first step starts at the source of the data, the gateway. To make sure your
gateway is actually receiving device data, you can use `tcpdump` to monitor
the data that is sent by your gateway.

When the LoRa Gateway Bridge is running on the gateway itself, then you need
to run the following command **on the gateway** (it will monitor the loopback interface):

{{<highlight bash>}}
sudo tcpdump -AUq -i lo port 1700
{{< /highlight >}}

When the LoRa Gateway Bridge is installed on a separate machine / server, the
you need to run the following command:

{{<highlight bash>}}
sudo tcpdump -AUq port 1700
{{< /highlight >}}

The above command can be executed on the gateway (if possible) or on the
machine where the LoRa Gateway Bridge component is installed. Running it
on the gateway will show the data sent by the gateway, running it on your
machine will show the data received by your machine.

When you see that data is sent by the gateway, but not received by your
machine / server, then likely there is a firewall inbetween that is blocking
the data.

### Expected tcpdump output

As the packet-forwarder sends regular "ping" messages, there is no need for
your device to send data. You should see a regular data-exchange in the
`tcpdump` output, for example:

{{<highlight text>}}
11:42:00.114726 IP localhost.34268 > localhost.1700: UDP, length 12
E..(..@.@."................'.....UZ.....
11:42:00.130292 IP localhost.1700 > localhost.34268: UDP, length 4

11:42:30.366310 IP localhost.1700 > localhost.34268: UDP, length 4
E..  .@.@....................S7.
{{< /highlight >}}

What we see in this log:

* `localhost.34268 > localhost.1700`: packet sent from the packet-forwarder to the LoRa Gateway Bridge
* `localhost.1700 > localhost.34268`: packet sent from the LoRa Gateway Bridge to the packet-forwarder


### No tcpdump output?

When `tcpdump` does not show anything, then likely the packet-forwarder on
the gateway is not running, or the packet-forwarder is misconfigured.

Inspect the `local_conf.json` of the packet-forwarder running on your gateway.
You might need to refer to your gateway manual to find out where you can locate
this file. This file could contain the following content:

{{<highlight json>}}
{
    "gateway_conf": {
        ...
        "serv_port_down": 1700,
        "serv_port_up": 1700,
        "server_address": "localhost",
        ...
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

What we learn from this file is that:

* It uses port `1700` (default port used by LoRa Gateway Bridge)
* It sends data to `localhost` (when LoRa Gateway Bridge is installed on the same device)

Make sure the ports and `server_address` are correct. In case LoRa Gateway
Bridge is not running on the same device, you need to replace this with
the correct hostname or IP of your LoRa Gateway Bridge instance. After making
any changes, donâ€™t forget to restart the packet-forwarder.

See [https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder/tree/master/lora_pkt_fwd](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder/tree/master/lora_pkt_fwd)
for more information about the packet-forwarder.

## LoRa Gateway Bridge receives data?

When the previous step confirmed that the gateway is sending data, you need to
confirm that the [LoRa Gateway Bridge](/lora-gateway-bridge/) is receiving
data from your gateway.

The first indications you will find in the LoRa Gateway Bridge logs. Depending
how the LoRa Gateway Bridge was installed on your system, one of the following
commands will show you the logs:

* `journalctl -f -n 100 -u lora-gateway-bridge`
* `tail -f -n 100 /var/log/lora-gateway-bridge/lora-gateway-bridge.log`

When the [packet-forwarder](https://github.com/lora-net/packet_forwarder) sends
data to the LoRa Gateway Bridge (this could be a "ping"), you will see the following logs:

{{<highlight text>}}
INFO[0013] mqtt: subscribing to topic qos=0 topic=gateway/7276ff002e062c18/command/#
{{< /highlight >}}

When your device sends an uplink message, you will see something like:

{{<highlight text>}}
INFO[0267] mqtt: publishing message qos=0 topic=gateway/7276ff002e062c18/event/up
{{< /highlight >}} 

If you see these logs, then this indicates that the LoRa Gateway Bridge
components receives the data sent by the packet-forwarder.

### No log output?

#### Double-check gateway

When you don't see any logs printed when your device sends an uplink message
double-check if the packet-forwarder sends data (previous section).

#### LoRa Gateway Bridge active?

You also need to make sure that the LoRa Gateway Bridge is actually active.
You can use the following command to check this:

{{<highlight bash>}}
ps aux |grep lora-gateway-bridge
{{< /highlight >}}

The output should look like:

{{<highlight text>}}
root      6403  0.0  0.2  12944  1088 pts/0    S+   12:53   0:00 grep --color=auto lora-gateway-bridge
gateway+ 23060  0.1  2.1 214260 10664 ?        Ssl  Aug30  47:55 /usr/bin/lora-gateway-bridge
{{< /highlight >}}

If no LoRa Gateway Bridge process is active, please refer to the
[LoRa Gateway Bridge Install](/lora-gateway-bridge/install/)
documentation.

#### LoRa Gateway Bridge configuration

When you have completed the previous steps succesfully, then packet-forwarder
data is received by your machine / server, but is not seen by the LoRa Gateway Bridge service.
This probably means that LoRa Gateway Bridge is binding on a different network
interface and / or port. Please check your `lora-gateway-bridge.toml` [Configuration](/lora-gateway-bridge/install/config).

## LoRa Gateway Bridge publishes data?

If you have confirmed that the LoRa Gateway Bridge component receives the
data sent by the packet-forwarder, it is time to confirm LoRa Gateway Brige is
succesfully publishing this data to the MQTT broker.

To validate that the LoRa Gateway Bridge is publishing LoRa frames to the MQTT
broker, you can subscribe to the `gateway/#` MQTT topic. When using the
`mosquitto_sub` utility, you can execute the following command:

{{<highlight bash>}}
mosquitto_sub -v -t "gateway/#"
{{< /highlight >}}

When you do not see any data appear when your device sends data, then make sure
the LoRa Gateway Bridge is authorized to publish to the MQTT topic **and**
the `mosquitto_sub` client is authorized to subscribe to the given MQTT topic.
This issue usually happens when you have configured your MQTT broker so that
clients need to authenticate when connecting.
